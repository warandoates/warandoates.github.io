## Welcome to BrickBreaker!


BrickerBreaker is a one-level, html-based version of the classic arcade game Breakout. The game was built using Javascript, CSS, and Phaser, an HTML-based game framework. This is my first pass at building a front-end application, utilizing OOP principles, taking advantage of browser tools like  localStorage, and incorporating a third-party API.
